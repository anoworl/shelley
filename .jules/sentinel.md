## 2025-05-27 - Path Traversal in File Serving Handler
**Vulnerability:** A path traversal vulnerability was found in `handleRead` in `server/handlers.go`. The handler accepted a `path` query parameter and checked if it started with a specific allowed directory prefix using `strings.HasPrefix`. However, it did not clean the path before this check, allowing attackers to use `../` sequences to traverse out of the allowed directory after the prefix match (e.g., `/allowed/../etc/passwd`).
**Learning:** `strings.HasPrefix` is insufficient for validating file paths when user input can contain `..` or other traversal characters. The path must be canonicalized before validation.
**Prevention:** Always use `filepath.Clean()` (or `filepath.Abs()` if dealing with absolute paths) to resolve directory traversal sequences before performing any prefix checks or access control logic. Ensure the prefix check includes a trailing separator to prevent partial name matching (e.g., `/tmp/dir` matching `/tmp/directory`).

## 2026-01-21 - Unrestricted File Upload Stored XSS
**Vulnerability:** The `handleUpload` function in `server/handlers.go` allowed uploading files with any extension. The `handleRead` function then served these files, setting the `Content-Type` header based on the extension or content sniffing. This allowed an attacker to upload an HTML file containing malicious scripts (Stored XSS) which would be executed when a user viewed the file via `handleRead`.
**Learning:** Even if filenames are randomized, preserving the original file extension without validation allows attackers to control the MIME type of the served content. Content sniffing (MIME sniffing) by `http.DetectContentType` can also lead to XSS if the server falls back to it for unknown extensions.
**Prevention:** Implement a strict allowlist of file extensions (e.g., images only) in the upload handler. Reject any upload that does not match the allowlist. Ensure that the file serving handler also respects these allowed types and does not inadvertently serve dangerous content types like `text/html`.
