## 2025-05-27 - Path Traversal in File Serving Handler
**Vulnerability:** A path traversal vulnerability was found in `handleRead` in `server/handlers.go`. The handler accepted a `path` query parameter and checked if it started with a specific allowed directory prefix using `strings.HasPrefix`. However, it did not clean the path before this check, allowing attackers to use `../` sequences to traverse out of the allowed directory after the prefix match (e.g., `/allowed/../etc/passwd`).
**Learning:** `strings.HasPrefix` is insufficient for validating file paths when user input can contain `..` or other traversal characters. The path must be canonicalized before validation.
**Prevention:** Always use `filepath.Clean()` (or `filepath.Abs()` if dealing with absolute paths) to resolve directory traversal sequences before performing any prefix checks or access control logic. Ensure the prefix check includes a trailing separator to prevent partial name matching (e.g., `/tmp/dir` matching `/tmp/directory`).

## 2026-01-14 - Arbitrary File Write in File Editing Handler
**Vulnerability:** An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in `handleWriteFile` in `server/handlers.go`. The handler only checked if the path was absolute (`filepath.IsAbs`) but did not verify that the path was safe to write to (specifically, it allowed writing to `.git` directories).
**Learning:** Allowing writes to `.git` directories is dangerous as it can lead to repository corruption or Remote Code Execution (RCE) via git hooks. While arbitrary file writes might be intended in some "open agent" designs, specific sensitive directories must always be protected.
**Prevention:** Explicitly block writing to sensitive directories like `.git` using case-insensitive checks, even if general file system access is allowed by design.
